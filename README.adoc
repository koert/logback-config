== Log debugging context with error
When you are developing software, you often come across unexpected situations that your software doesn't handle correctly.
In order to figure out what caused the problem, you a detailed log of what happened and what the input data was, so that
you can reproduce the situation in your development environment.

Sometimes the end users will produce situations and errors that we never thought of.
In those circumstances it is very helpful to examine the detailed logs.
Because of this, we let the software log detailed debugging information, even on the production systems.
The downside is that this will produce large log files, which may fill up file systems, and there is a performance penalty
for writing all that data.
